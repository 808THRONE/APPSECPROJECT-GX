# Docker Compose override for existing containers
# Since you're using standalone containers (postgres-iam, wildfly-iam),
# this file is optional. You can remove it if not needed.

# If you want to use docker-compose instead, uncomment and configure:
# services:
#   postgres:
#     # Override postgres settings if needed
#     container_name: postgres-iam
#     ports:
#       - "5432:5432"
